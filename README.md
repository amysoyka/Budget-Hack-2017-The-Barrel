# mybudgethack2017project

This repo is for the project I worked on throughout the State Government of Victoria Budget Hack 2017 event.
(Link for Official Website for Budget Hack 2017: https://www.budget.vic.gov.au/budgethack)

The final project, as upon the completion of the hackathon, can be seen here: http://u.osmfr.org/m/146359/
Initially the project started of as a sub-branch of an identical project - but evolved into a project based on its own merit.

Datasets that contributed to this project were:
Victorian State Budget 2017 (Point)
https://data.aurin.org.au/dataset/vic-govt-dtf-vic-govt-budget-2017-point-na
State Budget 2017-18 - Data Supporting the Budget Website Map Visualisation
https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/state-budget-2017-18-data-supporting-the-budget-website-map-visualisation
Victorian Lower House Electoral Boundaries 2013 - Vicmap Admin
https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/victorian-lower-house-electoral-boundaries-2013-vicmap-admin
Victorian Electoral Commission - State Election Results 2014
https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/State2014/Summary.html

Any additional interpretations of these datasets from these sources listed here were entirely my own.
(I produced a number of additional unique datasets myself throughout this project)

Also, please note, in relation to the budget project points, the dataset may be incomplete.
As a result, any conclusions drawn as a result of reviewing this dataset may not be absolute.
(I intend on doing further work in the future to ammend this issue)

If you would like to use any of this data for your own projects - please provide attribution (see license).
